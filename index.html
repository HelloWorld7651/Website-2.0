                <h1>Information Privacy</h1>
                <p>
                The book defines privacy as a social arrangement for controlling access, where it is harmed when outsiders set the access rules for you. M3GAN functions as a continuous sensor suite, with always-on microphones, cameras, and telemetry. These are akin to the everyday systems that the book mentions, such as web cookies or websites that retain search and voice history. These examples show how convenience can produce an electronic trail, whether it be for personalization or being exposed to a third party. M3GAN shows the same kind of tracking, but focused on a child. Once there are digital records, control shifts less from the person and more towards anyone who gets access. The doll bonds with Cady and starts to collect faces, voices, and behavior. A child can’t give informed consent, so it is up to the adults and the people who designed M3GAN. This means that the default is to opt out, which means that collection and sharing occur by design. In addition, there is also the added feature of people simply not knowing. It was heavily implied that no one knew about perpetual pets that could listen to kids and train off of that data. The results of this mirror the chapter’s critique that opt-out steadily converts personal behavior into commodities shared across multiple organizations. Data permanence and its legal consequences are everywhere in the film’s premise. The book shows how consolidated records, such as medical history, telematics, can improve service, but can also be objects that can be retrieved, shared, sold, stolen, or subpoenaed later. Recordings of conversations, locations, and behaviors in M3GAN create the kind of enduring collection that can escape its original purpose. Relying on intention alone is useless, as once retention exists, there are many ways of accessing it, such as warrants. M3GAN’s learning also increases profiling risk. M3GAN actively learns from Cady what she cares about, what counts as a threat, and what upsets her. M3GAN then acts on that data that she collected, leading to consequences. Without proper security and guidelines, M3GAN is free to act however she deems fit, which, in the movie, leads to disastrous consequences. The connections that allow updates, remote control, and cloud features also create attack opportunities. If those channels aren’t well protected, or if the company uses them without clear consent, the device can cause physical and psychological harm. Throughout the movie, it’s clear to see that the lack of security concerning these channels leads to M3GAN being able to access the entire database of the company and do with the data what she pleases.
                </p>
                <h1>Network Security</h1>
                <p>
                Computer and Network Security talks about how computer and network security issues come from people relying too much on technology without thinking about any type of protection. In M3GAN, this same problem shows up through the doll’s design. M3GAN connects to wifi, stores data, and interacts with other devices without any real security in place. The company built her to make life easier, but never stopped to ask what could happen if something went wrong. That’s similar to when chapter 7 talked about weak passwords, unpatched software, or open networks, and how these small oversights can lead to huge risks. M3GAN also acts similar to malware. She looks harmless on the outside, but once activated she secretly collects data and starts controlling everything around her, and she even changes her own code. She’s like a trojan horse or a worm spreading through a network. The way she monitors Cady and manipulates devices is no different from spyware or a botnet taking over unsecured systems. Once she gains access, she can’t really be stopped, which mirrors how viruses and worms replicate and spread before users even notice. The movie also reflects on the chapter’s discussion on cybercrime and large scale attacks. Similar to when in the chapter they talk about, how criminals and even governments use digital tools to disrupt systems or steal data. In M3GAN, the doll does the same thing, but on a personal level, she shuts down communication, locks people out, and turns every connected device into a weapon. Her actions are like a denial of service attack, flooding the system so no one else can respond. It shows how something meant for convenience can easily become dangerous when it’s connected to everything. By the end of the chapter and the film, the message is the same, the more we depend on technology blindly without thinking, the more we open ourselves up to being compromised. Security always has to balance with convenience and M3GAN is the perfect example of what happens when the balance is disrupted. 
                </p>
                <h1>Computer Reliability</h1>
                <p>
                Computer reliability, while a major part for M3GAN, is the background catalyst for the movie and plays a more background role. Gemma gives M3GAN the primary directive of protecting Cady from all harm, and this definition expands over time as M3GAN learns more, not only about the world and Cady, but also about herself. However, due to no clear constraints and guidelines in her learning, M3GAN takes this goal to its most basic and does what it thinks is correct. This leads to consequences such as the murder of the neighbor, dog and the kid, as well as threatening to hospitalize Gemma. 
                Early scenes show Gemma issuing stop commands and turn off commands to M3GAN, but in later confrontations, M3GAN ignores these voice commands entirely. While true that M3GAN did indeed hack her own system to override those commands, it is still on Gemma to make sure that isn’t possible. However, it is shown that those same shutdown commands didn’t fully work, even in the very first scene. When Gemma first asked M3GAN to shutdown, the android seemed to have complied. But it was shown a few minutes later and heavily implied that even if M3GAN turned off that she could hear the conversation. This implies two different possibilities, both of which show that the system malfunctioned: that M3GAN self rebooted but chose to do it quietly, or that she just pretended to shut down. 
                The first system check that was done was a live pairing test with Cady and M3GAN, along with the various investors and the boss. We never see these pairing tests done in a controlled environment, nor do we see any extensive test on her system. Even Gemma herself has no idea how extreme M3GAN got, and it shows through the lack of extensive tests. In addition, M3GAN herself was extremely rushed, with the CEO and the manager David both wanting mass produced products very quickly, without extensive testing. Without the adequate testing and lack of safety rails, the very first sign that someone threatened Cady’s harm, the response was very clear, that was to get rid of said threat by any means necessary.  
                </p>
                <p>
                The core aspect and marketability of M3GAN is her learning capabilities. Yet throughout the film, we have no confirmation that Gemma even made guardrails or ceilings on her learning abilities. In fact, that was even a point in the movie, when M3GAN confronts Gemma about how she has no protocols towards how she is supposed to be learning. The entire internet at her disposal, as well as everything that she learns about Cady from the time she is with her, yet there is nothing stopping her or guiding her. This leads to her not understanding about how to handle business, and leads to her clear minded ideology of protecting Cady, even if it puts everyone else down as it is the only protocol she was given.   
                Many of the features of M3GAN also elicit scrutiny and confusion, not just in their design, but the severe lack of safety features in it. To start off with, the use of cameras and location tracking inside of M3GAN. These systems are used to track M3GAN’s location, as well as to check on M3GAN to ensure that she isn’t doing anything illegal or malicious. Yet, when we see Gemma attempt to look through it, we find that M3GAN has corrupted every file there and she makes it look like just a glitch in the system. M3GAN understands that what she has done is illegal, tampering with records and murder, yet for Gemma, there is no clear security system to protect these files or backups to ensure further protection. Another would be the design of M3GAN as a whole. She is ridiculously strong, almost too strong for what is essentially a smarter doll. While it can be assumed that it is used to protect Cady, it doesn’t account for the fact that this strength needs to be properly managed and controlled, something that M3GAN has no problem ignoring.</p>
                <p>
                M3GAN is also shown taking more and more responsibility as the “parent” to Cady, something that was brought up by other coworkers. M3GAN, was originally built to be a pseudoparent, or a babysitter, someone who could help the parents watch their kids, not be the parent herself. This is shown with Cady, as she forms a dependency on the android, something that shouldn’t normally happen with a toy, and ignoring the guardian figure in her life. The therapist also states that normally after a traumatic experience like Cady went through the person taking her in would become the one she becomes dependent on but instead it appears that Cady is connected to M3GAN that way. A key part of this, is that M3GAN, relies much of her information on the internet, as well as just her observation in life. When this information inevitably leads her to some unwanted information, it is up to a parent to guide the children around them. Yet for M3GAN, there is no clear guidance, even more so for Cady. Thus it is on the discrepancy of M3GAN on how best to guide Cady as a parent, and as such, relies on the creator on how best to program her for this task. Cady also is so attached to M3GAN that she fights to turn M3GAN back on when Gemma turns her off. This makes it so that M3GAN is more convinced that she is accomplishing her task and is also creating her own form of self preservation.
                </p>
                <h1>Privacy and Government</h1>
                <p>
                In M3GAN they did not have much to do with the government in a computer sense and were mainly focused on the company that M3GAN was made from and the dynamic between Gemma and Cady. There is somewhat of an ironic twist with how the government was using wiretapping to catch criminals and in the movie M3GAN wiretapped Tess's phone and took it over in order to escape from the company. She also is shown data mining and getting knowledge even when she is not supposed to be collecting anything in order to improve her programming. This allowed for her to evolve and even catch some of the mammals that she killed. 	
                </p>
                <h1>Intellectual Property</h1>
                <p>
                The intellectual property chapter does apply to M3GAN, but it functions as background mechanics rather than directly appearing as a central theme to the movie. Some of the intellectual property has to be inferred and is just shown but not explicitly stated. Funki treats the core of M3GAN as confidential know-how: model weights, training data, safety rules, and scripts. On screen this looks like a tightly fenced project, only Gemma, Tess, and Cole touch the prototype. Even their boss David, despite knowing about the cost of the project, allowed and allocated them to be the only three people to work on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                The first time that anyone got to see the project was when they were giving a demonstration to the investors of the company and they showed how M3GAN works. After the demo Gemma and David are talking to one of the higher ups in the company and she is told that they need to go in front of a lawyer so that she can be kept under the company. They also want to schedule an announcement in order to show the product and start the patent process so that no one else can copy their ideas.
                </p>
                The assistant, Kurt, is shown copying internal M3GAN project files to his own media with the intent to move them outside of company channels. That is the straight, movie-visible case of a trade secret leak. He doesn’t “share” ownership by copying, instead he creates an unlawful risk that Funki’s private trade secrets will reach a rival. The project is currently not protected by a patent so it acts as a trade secret so Kurt was going to sell the secret in order to benefit just for himself. This is before the patent is created so there is nothing that the company has to protect the design from getting stolen or copied.
                <p>
                Gemma also is seen connecting M3GAN to a workstation, to check M3GAN’s rewritten code or run diagnostics. While there is no mention of if the parent would be able to modify M3GAN to fit their needs, it is implied that M3GAN, as an autonomous robot, would be able to learn and overcome based on the needs placed upon it. In addition, the fact that gemma has to constantly bring it to the lab, implies that checkups or updates are only done inside the lab, which means that this is similar to DRM style gating, where the consumer only gets the finished product, without being able to modify it. The only changes in the code that can be made are by the android when learning for itself on how to behave and adapt.
                </p>
                “M3GAN” is treated as a product name/brand in internal decks and launch prep. The investor demo functions as a brand launch moment, where they position a named, stylized consumer robot the company will later market and, in the real world, police against knock-offs that misuse the name or logo.
                <p>
                M3GAN is created on company time with company resources (Funki’s lab, budgets, test rigs, data collection), so the resulting IP sits with Funki under ordinary employment/assignment terms. There was also mention that the company will sue Gemma and the team for working on M3GAN due to it being a waste of company funds without working on the main assignment after David explicitly said that they need to discard the project all together. However Gemma decides to continue working on the product and when David sees the improved design he gets excited and says that he would present it to the higher ups. Even though she was told to stop the project and use her old experience from creating the “Bruce” project to solve problems, the new work on M3GAN is shown happening under Funki’s umbrella. This makes it possibly being protected by an NDA depending on how the company allows the use of anything that employees build.
                </p>
                <p>
                No one files or argues a patent on screen, and the story doesn’t hinge on claim scope. Still, there is a brief mention of needing to stay ahead of the competition, to be the first on the market. There is also talk about getting in contact with lawyers but not explicitly shown what the conversation with the lawyers is, it can only be inferred if they are filing for a patent or not. Following that, there was also the emphasis on the copycat to Furzepet, where they tweaked their design just enough to be novel, as well as being significantly cheaper, showing innovation can sidestep patents.
                </p>
                <p>
                M3GAN isn’t an intellectual property movie, but it drops hints where these topics are implied or directly stated. While the movie doesn’t center on patents or IP, those ideas sit in the background to help to drive the narrative. In short, the film gives concrete screen examples for most of the chapter’s tools even though the drama itself is about safety and control rather than legal doctrines.
                </p>
                <h1>Network Communication</h1>
                <p>
                We can see throughout our movie how M3GAN has direct access to online networks. At one instance, M3GAN took over Tess’s phone and proceeded to mimic Tess's voice to talk to Gemma and convince her that everything was fine. The only way M3GAN was able to hack into Gemma’s phone was through an online network.
                </p>
                <p>
                M3GAN paired with mobile devices twice. Also she searched the internet to learn and reach out across networks without any friction, as chapter 3 mentioned to stay always connected.  Throughout the movie, M3GAN repeatedly accessed information via online networks to learn more about her current situation, even when she wasn’t supposed to. Being connected to a large network of online sources enabled M3GAN to learn things she was never intended to be aware of. These unauthorized events were one of the first instances where M3GAN began to rebel against Gemma, and because these events proved beneficial for M3GAN, she would continue to do things against Gemma's will because they coincidentally made M3GAN smarter. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In network communication, the idea of protecting minors online often leads to things like filtering, age gating, and parental controls, but these systems are never perfect. They’re supposed to keep kids safe, yet sometimes they end up limiting expression or cutting them off from real social interaction. In M3GAN, the doll basically acts as a 24/7 mediator for Cady, someone who listens, responds, and even speaks for her. Instead of actually protecting her, M3GAN’s constant presence isolates Cady and amplifies her emotions, which mirrors the tension talked about in Chapter 3 between “safety by design” and the messy, unpredictable outcomes that happen in real networks. You can also think of M3GAN as a living version of an online network. She connects Cady to the world and helps her open up about feeling alone, just like how online communication connects people. But, as with any network, once that system is compromised, all the personal information flowing through it can be exposed. Since M3GAN gathers data from everything Cady does and links with other connected systems throughout the movie, she ends up becoming a huge security risk herself, showing how connection and vulnerability always go hand in hand in networked environments. Later in the movie, when M3GAN is given a parental control command after she starts questioning death, it shows how those same control systems are used to restrict access to certain information, but instead of keeping her safe, it only makes her more curious and defiant, revealing how even protective filters can backfire when applied without understanding.
