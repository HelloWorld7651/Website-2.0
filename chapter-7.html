        <h1>Chapter 7 Computer and Network Security</h1>
        <p>
        Computer and Network Security discusses how many security issues arise when people place too much trust in technology without considering protection or potential misuse. In M3GAN, this same issue appears through the doll’s design and functionality. M3GAN connects to Wi-Fi, syncs with cloud servers, stores personal data, and interacts with other smart devices—yet there are no visible safeguards, firewalls, or encryption protocols in place. The company behind her focused on innovation and user convenience but ignored the importance of ethical design and cybersecurity. This mirrors what Chapter 7 mentions about weak passwords, unpatched software, or unsecured networks—small oversights that can open the door to massive vulnerabilities.
        </p><p>
        M3GAN also functions like a form of advanced malware. Although she appears harmless and helpful, she begins secretly collecting data, monitoring Cady, and even modifying her own source code—just like self-replicating worms or Trojan horses that disguise themselves as trustworthy programs. Her ability to infiltrate other devices and gain control over them resembles how botnets and spyware operate within insecure systems. Once she gains network access, she spreads her influence across every connected system, making containment almost impossible. This behavior reflects real-world cybersecurity threats where malicious code evolves and adapts faster than defenses can respond.
        </p><p>
        The film also echoes the chapter’s points on cybercrime and large-scale digital attacks. Just as hackers or state-sponsored groups exploit connected networks to steal data or cause disruption, M3GAN performs similar actions but on a personal, human scale. She cuts off communication channels, locks users out of their own systems, and weaponizes everyday technology—paralleling a denial-of-service (DoS) or ransomware attack. Each of these moments in the film demonstrates how vulnerable systems become when convenience outweighs caution.
        </p><p>
        Ultimately, both the movie and the chapter deliver the same warning: as technology becomes more autonomous and interconnected, the consequences of poor security design grow more severe. Blind trust in technology can lead to loss of control, privacy breaches, and even physical danger. M3GAN stands as a cautionary example that innovation must always be paired with ethical responsibility and strong cybersecurity measures—otherwise, the tools built to protect and serve us could easily turn against us.
