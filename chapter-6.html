        <h1>Chapter 6 Privacy and the Government</h1>
        <p>In M3GAN, they did not have much to do with the government in a computer sense and were mainly focused on the company that M3GAN was made from and the dynamic between Gemma and Cady. There is somewhat of an ironic twist with how the government was using wiretapping to catch criminals, and in the movie M3GAN, they wiretapped Tess's phone and took it over to escape from the company. She also is shown data mining and getting knowledge even when she is not supposed to be collecting anything in order to improve her programming. This allowed her to evolve and even catch some of the mammals that she killed. </p>
