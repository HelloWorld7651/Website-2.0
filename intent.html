      <h1>Movie Maker Intent</h1>
      <p>In M3GAN, the filmmakers use artificial intelligence as a warning about what can happen when technology develops faster than our ability to control it. The movie isn’t just about a killer robot; it’s about how easily people hand over emotional and parental responsibilities to machines. Through M3GAN’s lifelike behaviour and independent thinking, the film raises questions about how far we’re willing to let computing technologies replace human judgment and connection. The director appears to suggest that while advanced AI can make life easier, it also blurs moral boundaries and can have serious consequences when it begins to act beyond its intended programming. In the end, M3GAN reminds viewers that just because we can build intelligent systems doesn’t always mean we should trust them completely.
